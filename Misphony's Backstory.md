# Misphony's Backstory

## A Family Whole

I was born into a happy home in Redfell, not far from East City. My mother was caring and gentle. As early as I could walk I became to share her hobbies, as she would frequently read to me tales of folk heros and adventurers from the many books she kept in the study. She was a voratous reader herself, and inspired that trait in me. I often imagined my father as  the hero, or myself along side him as a companion, in the many tales those words conjured in my mind. 

My father was an adventurer, working out of the guild in Valeros. He was rarely at home, but when he returned he would stay months at a time. It was clear my parents' love was strong, for when he was home they would share many tender moments especially at night by the fireside. I suppose my father must have been a great adventurer, for we afforded an upper-class lifestyle beyond that typical of tieflings without noble blood. My family didn't keep servants as a rule, perhaps either due to a familial distrust in outsiders, outsiders distrust in us, or out of principle, I would never know. My mother was capable enough, and my father would aid her with tasks requiring a man's touch around our humble estate, such as repairing fences, ensuring ample firewood, and the like.

When I was five, our family expanded by one with the birth of my dear sister Ebrilla. Ebrilla was born premature, and my father, who was off an adventure, was not present for her birth. Despite her early arrival, Ebrilla was hearty at birth, and showed no signs of ill-health, requiring not additional treatment from the local cleric or apothicary. 

My mother, however, did not fair as well. After giving birth, my mother contracted a disease of the blood and began to wither. The local professions did their best work, but the disease was beyond their capabilities. I lent our house seal to the local cleric so he could send a currier to Valeros to the Adventurers Guild to reach my father, and so the guilld could send High Cleric from Valeros to tend to my mother. Two more weeks passed before we received word: my father was en route, with a renown cleric from his party, to treat my mother immediately. However, my mother had already passed that very morning.

## Grief for the Ghost

My father was never really the same man after the passing of my mother. I do believe he still loved me and my sister deeply, but he was unable to express affection in the same way. I found it strange that even when he would smile or chuckle, his eyes would hold a sadness that didn't wane. His adventures began to stretch in length and duration he spent at home between them began to shrink. I suspect he had offered money to the locals to look after us, as a selection of elderly woman, retired husbands, and young mothers with children of a similar age would check in of us, taking turns every couple of days, providing occassional supper or assisting with a chore, although I could determine no discernable schedule or rotation they shared. For the most part, I looked after my sister, reading to her just like my mother read to me, trying to play the role of caring parent, though I knew I was a crude, surrogate imitation. We carried along like this for a decade before tragedy struck.

On the eve of my sister's fifth birthday, there came a knock at the door. This being a Season of Tumbling Leaves, the sun had long since set, which had left me cozied up by the fire reading a book by candlelight while Ebrilla slept upstairs. Only Ebrilla and I were home. Two seasons prior, myather had left for on a journey. From the way he had described his upcoming adventure, I had suspect he only intended to be away from a month, or perhaps a month and one half at most. However, two seasons later he still hadn't returned, his typical absence stretched to an uncharacteristic extent. 

Unsure who would be calling at this hour, but confident it was likely a neighbor, I approached the door and peeped through the keyhole. On the other side stood a tall, pale man wearing a flowing dark cloak, though my memory of his facial features is foggy. He called from the other side of the door, "Salutations. I'm looking for the estate of Merias, Tribune of the Axe. May I speak with the warden of this house?"

Astonished to hear my father's name and title, I unbolted the door. A thought shot into my mind that perhaps this person was not to be trusted, and could potentially be an adversary of my father. I buried the thought in my subconscious, though my body was now on high alert. The stranger heared the door unlock but did not react. He stood eerily still as the cold wind billowed his cloak.

"Young man", he called. "May I see your face so we can speak matter of fact?" It was lost on me at the time that he could not have known who was behind the door. But nevertheless his voice was calm and pleasant, which began to set me at ease. I peeped the door only slightly to get a better look. The man stood tall, about six feet and three inches. He worn no weapon at his hip and carried no rucksack. He raised a hand to greet me. Smiling pleasantly, he said "Ahh, you must be Merias' boy. It is a pleasure to meet you. I bring word from Valeros, from the guild!" He paused, waiting for me to respond. I didn't say a word, but I opened the door completely and stared at his face.

He stood opposite the threshold of me, and grasped at his hat when the wind blew and nearly took it. "The guild has sent me to retreave an item in your father's possession. His handler had expected Merias to return the item himself, but he's been gone much longer than expected. In his absense, I am to retreave this item for the Guildmaster."

"What item?" I asked.

The Stranger at the Door paused for a moment before answering. "I'm to retreve some documentation from your father's study, young man. It is a paper of some import. Perhaps you could bring me to his study?"

"I can retreave it for you, if you like, sir." I said.

"Ah, young boy, I appreciate the offer, but the document is rather unremarkable. I don't think I'd be able to sufficiently describe it to you such that you may retreive it yourself. I worry you could spend all evening looking through his files and not finding the right one. If I may enter, I could help you locate it promptly."

I thought for a second, before stepping back away from the door, and beconing him in. The Stranger at the Door didn't move. He stood outside in the cold, clutching his hat while the blustering wind continued. "The document will help the Guildmaster plan a future activity. I believe your father had encountered a rare beast while abroad, and recorded his findings in a report for the guild, though through mistake the report was either lost by the guild, or never delivered. If we could find this document, the Guildmaster could prepare another party for a future, similar encounter. May I come in to take a look?"
